## Description
Being that developers are often tasked with retrieving data from other applications API and using it in the context of their own, I decided to build a weather dashboard. This allowed me to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to the open weather map API. I had a lot of fun making this and it's awesome to see how my coding skills are progressing. This weather dashboard features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

#### Usage
This weather dashboard is used for anybody that wants to see the weather outlook for multiple citys, just in case they want to plan a trip accordingly. Once you search for a city, you are instantly presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is also added to your search history. It also will show you a icon for the weather presented for that day, as well as, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
